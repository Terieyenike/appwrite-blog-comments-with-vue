### Project Description

How to use Appwrite's DB service to create comments on a blog post. A comment can be written, edited, displayed, and deleted.

Also you can create a dummy static blog post with a comment section that anyone can type into, to add a comment.
Use a blog ID to store comments in the DB.

Finally, you can create a local appwrite instance by running the Docker CLI or Docker desktop and then running the Unix command specified in this [installation guide](https://appwrite.io/docs/installation).
